    "# Demo for generating substrates and running a single simulation\n",
    "This notebook is intended as a demo that reproduces a single simulation with generic parameters for the substrate geometry and the sequence applied. Readers are free to alter the parameters and use this as a base example for their own explorations. For a more general introduction to MCMRSimulator, see [its dedicated tutorial](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/v0.11/). Note this demo uses the latest stable version of MCMRSimulator as of 2025-1, v0.11.0 and in our paper we used v0.9.0."
