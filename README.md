# MT-and-permeability-effect-on-two-compartment-dMRI-WM-model
Repo for code that reproduces the results and analysis in the paper Investigating the sensitivity of diffusion MRI measurements to magnetization transfer and permeability via Monte-Carlo simulations &lt;add link>

## Pre-requisite
1. Install Julia from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Install MCMRSimulator version 0.9.0 following its [documentation](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/ndcn0236/mcmrsimulator.jl/v0.9/installation/).
3. Install Python 3.13 and above with jupyter notebook, numpy 2.2.1.

## General operation
The notebook <add name> demonstrates how to set up a single simulation using parallel cylinder substrates and diffusion-weighted spin echo sequences.
