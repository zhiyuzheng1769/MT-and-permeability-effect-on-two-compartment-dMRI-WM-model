    "# Create distributed cylinders\n",
    "This note book uses MCMRSimulator v0.9.0 and custom function `repel_distributed_radius()` in `repel_cylinders.jl` to generate parallel cylinder substrates with Gamma-distributed diameters for our simulation. The custom function is needed because MCMRSimulator's built-in function `random_positions_radii()` generated cylinder packing configurations that were highly inhomogeneous, which resulted in clusters of cylinders and large gaps between clusters. This affected the consistency and accuracy of our simulated signal. `repel_distributed_radius()` takes the output of `random_positions_radii()` and add repulsions between cylinders to create a more homogeneous packing configuration. It returns the positions and radius of all cylinders in a block. The `Cylinders()` constructor then creates the cylinder object in the simulation with the given position and radius and infinitely repeats the block to fill in all space. In later versions of MCMRSimulator, such as the v0.11.0 we used for the example simulation, the custom function has been integrated into the `random_positions_radii()`, therefore using `random_positions_radii()` alone is sufficient."
